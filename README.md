## MTN Côte d'Ivoire

### INTRODUCTION
Introduction
MTN Côte d'Ivoire (MTNCI) is an Ivorian telecommunications provider that offers postpaid and prepaid GSM services, including fixed line, mobile, and internet. MTN Côte d'Ivoire (MTNCI) is a part of the MTN Group, based in South Africa.

### OBJECTIVE
"How should MTN go about upgrading its infrastructure plan within the cities?" is the research topic for this project. In order to break down the processes and various tactics, one will use the CRISP-DM technique. One will also use python programming to aid in comprehending how the analysis was carried out and prompting recommendations to help MTN Cote d'Ivoire  figure out the best way for it to undertake the required modifications. Some questions to get one started;

1. Which ones were the most used city for the three days?
2. Which cities were the most used during business and home hours?
3. Most used city for the three days?

### PROCEDURE
1. Data Preparation

One will choose the data, clean, integrate, and generate the data needed for analysis at this phase in the CRISP-DM technique. One will then identify which bits of the provided dataset are required for analysis and which are not by constructing required data. Any duplicate data will be removed, one will also do data scrubbing, check for missing values, and general data cleaning in this stage. It also entails the formatting of data. The quality of the data I'll be using for my analysis will be determined at this stage.

2. Data Analysis

It involves selection of modeling methodologies and the identification of a model to be utilized in choosing the best approach. A model is created and evaluated while test designs are created.

3. Conclusion

Evaluation is then done to aid in the determination of the data's accuracy and its importance. It determines whether the conclusions gained from the data presented, after analysis, meet the research question's objectives.

4. Recommendation

One will then provide recommendations based on the research issue to help MTN Cote d'Ivoire go about the upgrade of its infrastructure strategy within the given cities.

### Software used
1. Python programming
2. Google collab
